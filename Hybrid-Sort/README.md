Homework Assignment #1: Hybrid Sort

Write a program that sorts a 2D-array of comparable keys into an 1D-array where all the keys are sorted in ascending order.
Perhaps, the easiest way is to merge all rows in the input array into an 1D-array then sort it. The implementation of this strategy is provided to establish the baseline: HybridSortChoi. Your goal is to design a sorting mechanism that gives a noticeable speed-up over this baseline.
