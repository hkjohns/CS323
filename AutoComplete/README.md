Homework Assignment #2: Auto Complete

1. Create a class called LastNameAutoComplete
2. Store all words from a dictonary file to LastNameAutoComplete
3. Get a prefix from the standard input and print 20 candidates matching the prefix if exists. The most recently selected candidate should appear at the top, the 2nd most recently selected candidate should appear at the 2nd, and so on. The rest of the candidate list should be filled with the shortest words matching the prefix. Make sure the same candidate does not appear more than once.
4. Get the selected candidate from the standard input. If the candidate does not exist in the trie, store it. Also, remember this is the most recently selected candidate for that particular prefix.
